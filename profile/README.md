## Project Roadmap

We are going to be using this repository's [Project](https://github.com/uselagoon/community/projects/1) as a temporary roadmap whilst we complete our website.

## Project Discussions

Likewise, we will be consolidating discussions about Lagoon into this repository - https://github.com/uselagoon/community/discussions.  We will continue to ask our community for input, and try to hold some of the coordination here.

## Documentation

Our main documentation has been collated over at https://docs.lagoon.sh - head over there to see what's what - if you think we're missing something, please let us know.

## Social Media

We have a twitter account at https://www.twitter.com/uselagoon

Our Instagram is at https://www.instagram.com/uselagoon if we work out what to post there!

We're in the process of setting up a few others too.

## Blog

Check out our blog over at https://dev.to/uselagoon, where we write about how we make Lagoon, tools we use and love, and Open Source bits of interest.
