## Documentation
Our main documentation has been collated over at https://docs.lagoon.sh - head over there to see what's what - if you think we're missing something, please let us know.

## Roadmap
We are going to be using this repository's Project as a temporary roadmap whilst we complete our website.

## Project Discussions
Likewise, we will be consolidating discussions about Lagoon into this repository - https://github.com/uselagoon/community/discussions. We will continue to ask our community for input, and try to hold some of the coordination here.

## Community Hours

We will be holding regularly scheduled community hours, where anyone in the community is welcome to drop in and ask us questions, talk about projects, and chat.

We currently hold community hours every two weeks, alternating between timezones. For 2023, we have also added text-based chats in the Lagoon Discord, so folks can join asynchronously, without missing anything. 

### US timezone 
Every fourth Thursday, in the US afternoon / AusNZ early morning - check your timezone and next meeting at https://dateful.com/eventlink/2693259984.

### EU timezone
Every fourth Tuesday, in the EU morning / AusNZ evening - check your timezone and next meeting at https://dateful.com/eventlink/3029145427.

## Contribution

As an open source project, we LOVE contributions. We have some info on getting started in our documentation: https://docs.lagoon.sh/contributing/ . We'd also love for you to join us at a community hour or through any of our social media to chat about how you can contribute to Lagoon!
