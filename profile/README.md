## Documentation
Our main documentation has been collated over at https://docs.lagoon.sh - head over there to see what's what - if you think we're missing something, please let us know.

## Roadmap
We are going to be using this repository's Project as a temporary roadmap whilst we complete our website.

## Project Discussions
Likewise, we will be consolidating discussions about Lagoon into this repository - https://github.com/uselagoon/community/discussions. We will continue to ask our community for input, and try to hold some of the coordination here.

## Contribution

As an open source project, we LOVE contributions. We have some info on getting started in our documentation: https://docs.lagoon.sh/contributing/ . We'd also love for you to join us at a community hour or through any of our social media to chat about how you can contribute to Lagoon!
